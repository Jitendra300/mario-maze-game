This is a Mario Maze Game. Your AIM is to get Mario reach the flag.
If you can't find the route then press 'A' and see Mario solving the maze by itself.

Also each time you play this game new Maze is created!

While you find the route, you will be accompained with pleasant random music stored in /sounds directory
* Well I forgot the github repo from which I took this sounds file but tqqq for the User who provided such
songs!
